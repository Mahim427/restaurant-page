## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript (ES6)

### What I learned

While working on this project:

- Figured out how to use npm and Webpack to organize and bundle my JavaScript code neatly.
- Learned how to break my code into modules and share functionality between files using imports/exports.
- Discovered how to create reusable components in JavaScript to generate HTML elements dynamically.
